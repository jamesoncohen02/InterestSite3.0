## How to Locally Build the Website (If You Have All the Backend Files)
*Note: You will at the very least need all the .ejs and .less files, the content.json file, and the blog_generator.js file. Additionally, you will need to have set up a build folder with, at the very least, an empty css folder and an images folder with the necessary images for this site within that build folder.*
1. Make sure that you have downloaded Node.js. In order to do so, click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Install the fs, ejs, and LESS by entering this project folder and typing each of the following into the command line:
    * `npm install fs --save`
    * `npm install ejs --save`
    * `npm install less --save`
